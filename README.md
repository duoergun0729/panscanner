Personal cloud storage, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud,  has brought various conveniences to people's lives, but also brought various privacy risks. Once hackers intrude into personal cloud storage accounts, a large number of privacy information will be leaked, such as taking private photos of sensitive parts, taking photos of important certificates, recording personal sensitive data files, etc. At the same time, intentional or unintentional anonymous sharing can easily lead to sensitive data being obtained by malicious individuals or organizations.
This topic will introduce how to use AI technology to protect the privacy and security of personal cloud storage, as follows:

How to use the object detection model to detect the sensitive credentials in personal cloud storage, and automatically mosaic the credentials in the images according to the needs.

How to use computer vision model to recognize the pictures of sensitive parts of the body in personal cloud storage, and automatically mosaic the pictures according to the needs.

How to use expert rules and NLP model to detect the sensitive personal information such as ID number, personal biometric information, address, contact person in the personal cloud storage, and automatically desensitize sensitive fields according to needs.

How to use the weak supervision algorithm, based on the existing noisy and imperfect expert rules, quickly obtain a large number of sensitive or insensitive training data, so as to further train a strong text classifier, improve the ability of automatically discovering sensitive data in personal cloud storage.
